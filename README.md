# Vue Income Tracker
This project is based on [Tyler Potts' Youtube tutorial on Vue 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjV7k7t78Ik). Notice that the master branch contains some improvements, such as using `reduce()` to sum totals. 

This branch implements the `removeItem` method. Notice that the app architecture forces cascading events up till reach the app root (`App.vue`). This **is not** the best approach, but I did not want to change the initial architecture.

## Project Overview

### Main Screen

<img src="./pics/MainPage.png" />

This is a single page project. The main screen features a header and a total income conter on the top of the page, followed by the input values and the income list. 

## Views and Components Overview

<img src="./pics/ComponentTree.png" />

Different from most projects so far, this uses one single _View_ - the `App.vue`. Therefore, the tree consists of components that are aggregated on the `App.vue` _View_.

* `App.vue` groups visible components in the main page. It also keeps the data structure and the `addIncome` method for adding new incomes;

* `Header.vue` just shows the total sum of all incomes;

* `Form.vue` handles data input, by sending the data via the `add-income` event;

* `IncomeList.vue` receives data structure and iterate over it, calling the `IncomeItem` to show individual data;

* `IncomeItem.vue` just formats the date and show values.

## Dependencies
